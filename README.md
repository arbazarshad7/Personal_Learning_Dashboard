# Personal Learning Dashboard - Sync with Blockchain Data

## 1. Project Title
**Personal Learning Dashboard - Sync with Blockchain Data**

## 2. Project Description
This smart contract allows users to record and view their personal learning progress on the Stacks blockchain. It helps in tracking how many courses the user has completed, ensuring transparency and immutability of educational achievements. All progress updates are linked to the user's wallet address.

## 3. Project Vision
To create a decentralized, verifiable, and secure learning tracker that empowers individuals to own their educational journey on the blockchain. The dashboard can later integrate with DApps, resumes, or decentralized identities (DIDs) for professional use.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add certificate NFT issuance on course completion
- Integrate with front-end dashboard using Clarity SDK and Stacks.js
- Support for different subjects, course types, and learning levels
- Verification layer for institutions to validate completions

## 5. Contract Address
**`SPXXXXXX.../learning-dashboard.clar`**  
(*Replace with deployed address after mainnet or testnet deployment*)
